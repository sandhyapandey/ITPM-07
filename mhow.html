Janapav hill<br>
The river Chambal which flows through the dacoit infested areas of Northern India is said to begin at the hill of Janapav <br>which is in a village named Kuti, around 15 km from Mhow town.<br> On top of the hill of Janapav is a temple and ashram. <br>According to local legend this used to be the ashram of Jamadagni, <br>the father of Parashurama (an Avatar or reincarnation of Vishnu, the Hindu God of sustenance). <br>A mela, or religious fair, is held at Kuti every year on the auspicious day of Kartik Purnima - the first full moon after Diwali, <br>which is also celebrated as Guru Nanak's birthday by the Sikh community - and people <br> from villages far and near come to pray and pay their obeisance. The next day the same mela shifts to the Balaji temple in Badgonda village.

The river Gambhir which eventually joins the Kshipra - the river on whose bank<br>s the ancient, holy city of Ujjain is built - also begins at the hill of Janapav. From there it<br> flows north towards Mhow.</div>
